# repox
This repository details information about CTDA being a DPLA service hub and how it implements Repox for that purpose.

Repox is a data aggregation and interoperability manager. Information can be found at: http://sysresearch.org/repox/.

Repox was implemented in the summer of 2016 at the University of Connecticut Libraries. Because of a bug with Repox that didn't allow to transform an oai_dc to a slightly differently structured oai_dc file, both oai_dc and mods were transformed to rdf.
